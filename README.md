# 04-Are-You-Smarter-Than-A-5th-Grader

## Description
Challenge 04 from the University of Minnesota FullStack Flex Coding Bootcamp

This project focuses on using Web API's to build a timed quiz. Through this project I learned about Web API's and Client-Side Storage, as well as more about events. I learned about the Document Object Model and interactivity. Through these topics I've also learned about events and how to handle those events using methods such as addEventListener.
